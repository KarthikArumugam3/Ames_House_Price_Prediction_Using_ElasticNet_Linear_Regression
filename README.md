The project is about a Linear regression model used for predictions of house prices.

The whole code is divide into 4 parts:-
1. Dealing with the outliers in the data and removing them.
2. Dealing with the missing data in the various categories within the dataset and deciding between dropping or filling them with appropriate values.
